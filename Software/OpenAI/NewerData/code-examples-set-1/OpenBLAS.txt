Use Case: OpenBLAS is an optimized open-source library for handling Linear Algebra (BLAS) operations, including matrix multiplication, dot product, vector addition and scaling, and more. It is commonly used with languages like C, C++, and Fortran for developing high-performance applications in fields such as machine learning, computational physics, and quantitative finance.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```c
#include <cblas.h>
#include <stdio.h> 
    
void main() {
   double A[6] = {1.0, 2.0, 1.0, -3.0, 4.0, -1.0}; 
   double B[6] = {1.0, 2.0, 1.0, -3.0, 4.0, -1.0}; 
   double C[9] = {.5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .5}; 
   cblas_dgemm(CblasRowMajor, CblasNoTrans, CblasNoTrans, 3, 3, 2, 1.0, A, 3, B, 3, 1.0, C, 3); 
   
   for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++)
      printf("%lf ", C[i]); 
   printf("\n"); 
}
```
The above code multiplies two 3x2 matrices `A` and `B` using the function `cblas_dgemm()` and adds the result to a 3x3 matrix `C`. The output matrix `C` is printed to the terminal.

Command to compile the code (with OpenBLAS installed in '/opt/OpenBLAS'):

```bash
gcc -I/opt/OpenBLAS/include -L/opt/OpenBLAS/lib -lopenblas -o matrix_mul code.c
```

Command to run the compiled executable:

```bash
./matrix_mul
```

Note: The paths '/opt/OpenBLAS/include' and '/opt/OpenBLAS/lib' are assumed to be where the OpenBLAS header files and libraries are respectively stored in the system. Please replace these with the appropriate paths as per the installation.
