Use Case: Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) is a set of computational routines, hand-optimized specifically for Intel processors. The library supports many functionalities including BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms), LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage), sparse solvers, Fast Fourier Transformation, Vector Math and more.

Code details and examples:

Code:
```
#include <mkl.h>

int main() {
    double A[2][2], B[2], X[2];
    int n = 2, nrhs = 1, lda = 2, ldb = 2, info;
    int ipiv[2];
    A[0][0] = 1.80; A[0][1] = 2.88; A[1][0] = 5.25; A[1][1] = -2.95;
    B[0] = 9.52; B[1] = 24.35;
    info = LAPACKE_dgesv(LAPACK_ROW_MAJOR, n, nrhs, *A, lda, ipiv, B, ldb);
    X[0] = B[0]; X[1] = B[1];
    return 0;
}
```
This is a C programm to solve the system of linear equations AX = B using Intel MKL's LAPACKE_dgesv routine. Matrix A and vector B are given while solution for X is found.

To compile and run this example:
You can use Intel's C compiler `icc`,
```
icc -o sample sample.c -lmkl_rt
./sample
```
Above commands will compile the code with Intel MKL and execute the binary.
