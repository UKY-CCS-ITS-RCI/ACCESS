Use Case: AlphaFold is a computational software tool for predicting protein structure from amino acid sequence. It is developed by DeepMind and is widely used in protein structure prediction competitions and also in real-world scientific research.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

Here's an example of how to run AlphaFold on a single sequence (in FASTA format). We need two files for this: `input.fasta`, `run_alphafold.py`. 

1. Input File: input.fasta (Fasta Format)
```
>sequenceID
MNIFEMLRIDEGLRLKIYKDTEGYYTIGIGHLLTKSPSLNAAAKSELDKAIGRNTNGVITKDEAEKLFNQDVDAAVRGILRNAKLKPVYDSLDAVRRC
```
This sequence represents a single example protein. 

2. Running Script: run_alphafold.py
```python
from alphafold.common import protein
from alphafold.data import parsers
from alphafold.data import pipeline
from alphafold.model import model

# Parse the input sequence.
fasta_path = 'input.fasta'
with open(fasta_path, 'r') as f:
  input_fasta_str = f.read()
fasta_parser = parsers.FastaParser(input_fasta_str)
fasta_dict = fasta_parser.parse()

# Run the AlphaFold prediction pipeline.
msa_clusterer = pipeline.MsaClusterer(
  max_clusters=1,
  msa_coverage=0.8,
  remove_gaps=True)
a3m_dict = msa_clusterer.get_a3m(fasta_dict)
alphafold_runner = pipeline.AlphafoldRunner()
result = alphafold_runner.predict(input_fasta_str, a3m_dict)

# Print the predicted protein structure.
protein_printer = protein.ProteinPrinter()
protein_structure_str = protein_printer.print(result)
print(protein_structure_str)
```
This script parses the input sequence, runs AlphaFold to generate a prediction, and then prints the predicted protein structure.

Command to run: Using python interpreter, run the script with
```
python run_alphafold.py
``` 

Note: The output will be the predicted 3D structure of the protein represented as a string. This version oversimplified much of the actual pipeline and parameters in software for brevity. It does not represent how actual AlphaFold is run, which involves complex database management and produces rich detailed outputs.
