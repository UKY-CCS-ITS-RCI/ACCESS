Use Case: netCDF is a widely used set of software libraries and self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. An example capitalizes on visualization of weather data.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

```
from netCDF4 import Dataset
import numpy as np

rootgrp = Dataset("test.nc", "w", format="NETCDF4")
print(rootgrp.data_model)

fcstgrp = rootgrp.createGroup("forecasts")
fcstgrp1 = rootgrp.createGroup("/forecasts/model1")
fcstgrp2 = rootgrp.createGroup("/forecasts/model2")

print(rootgrp.groups)
```

Input File: test.nc (a NetCDF file)

Specifications & Details:

- An example of group hierarchy within the test.nc file

Command to run: The pyhton file can be run from the terminal using `python filename.py` where filename is the name of the python file where the code is saved.

This will print:

```
NETCDF4
{'forecasts': <class 'netCDF4._netCDF4.Group'>
group /forecasts:
    dimensions(sizes): 
    variables(dimensions): 
    groups: model1, model2}
```
This output indicates that the "forecasts" group has two subgroups: "model1" and "model2". These groups can be used to organize related data within a netCDF file.
