Use Case: Git is a widely-used version control system. It tracks changes to a set of files, allowing multiple persons to work on them independently.

Code details and examples: Code:

1. Creating a new repository

First, you create a new directory, navigate to it and run the git init command to set up a new repository.

```
mkdir my-git-project
cd my-git-project
git init
```

2. Adding Files to the Repository

After creating some files in your project, you can add them to the git repository using the git add command.

```
echo "Hello Git" > hello.txt
git add hello.txt
```

3. Committing Changes to Repository

To save your changes into the repository, you run the git commit command.

```
git commit -m "First commit"
```

4. Pushing Changes to a Remote Server

If you want to push your changes to a remote server, you need to add the URL of the remote repository with the git remote command, then push using the git push command.

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
git push -u origin master
```

In this case, the input is either a file or a command, depending on the operation. The git commands are run on the terminal. You can also access the help section of any git command by typing "git help <command>" into the terminal.
