Use Case: LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) is utilized for molecular dynamics simulations. It can model hard or soft, solid or fluid, single or multiple chemical species, particles that interact short or long range, particles with or without charge, etc.

Code Details and Example:
An example input script for LAMMPS might look something like these:

Code:

```
# 3d Lennard-Jones melt

units       lj
atom_style  atomic

lattice     fcc 0.8442
region      box block 0 4 0 4 0 4
create_box  1 box
create_atoms 1 box
mass        1 1.0

velocity    all create 1.44 87287 loop geom

pair_style  lj/cut 2.5
pair_coeff  1 1 1.0 1.0 2.5

neighbor    0.3 bin
neigh_modify delay 0 every 20 check no

fix         1 all nve

dump        id all atom 50 dump.melt

thermo      100
thermo_modify temp all

run         10000
```

This input creates a 3d Lennard-Jones melt, creates atoms, sets their velocity, define interactions, selects the molecular dynamics integrator and runs the simulation.

Running Script:

This input script is typically run using the command:
```
lmp_serial < in.melt
```
In this case, `lmp_serial` is the LAMMPS executable and `in.melt` is the script/ input file.
