Use Case: CMake is a compiler tool that is used to control the compilation process using simple configuration files, CMakeLists.txt. It is a cross-platform tool that generates makefiles for many platforms.

Code details and examples: Code 

For this example, consider the structure of your C/C++ project to be:
Your Project Directory
  ├── CMakeLists.txt
  ├── main.cpp
  └── ...

And in main.cpp:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, CMake!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Your CMakeLists.txt could be as follows:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

# set the project name
project(HelloCMake)

# add the executable
add_executable(HelloCMake main.cpp)
```

This basic CMakeLists.txt simply sets the minimum required version of CMake for a project, sets the project's name, and indicates the files needed to compile an executable.

The place of CMake in a build process:
1. Create a build directory, and switch to it.
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
2. Run `cmake` with the path to the source code (the parent directory).
```
cmake ..
```
3. Run `make` to build the targets specified in the Makefile that CMake generated.
```
make
```
After the make command succeeds, the executable will be generated in the "build" directory.
