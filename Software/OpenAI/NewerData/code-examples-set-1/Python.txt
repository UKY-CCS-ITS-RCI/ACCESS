Use Case: Python is often used for data analysis tasks. For example, the pandas library allows for data manipulation and analysis; matplotlib allows for data visualization; and NumPy provides support for numerical operations.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Read data from a CSV file using pandas
data = pd.read_csv("your_file.csv")

# Use NumPy to calculate the mean of a column
mean = np.mean(data['your_column'])

# Plot a histogram of a column using matplotlib
plt.hist(data['your_column'])
plt.show()
```

In this example, the input file ("your_file.csv") is a CSV file with at least one column named "your_column". This CSV file can be created in a text editor or spreadsheet software like Excel. The data in 'your_column' should be numerical.

The command to run the script is as follows:

```
python your_script.py
```

You must replace "your_script.py" with the name of your script and "your_file.csv" with the name of your CSV file. "your_column" should be replaced with the name of the column you wish to analyze.
