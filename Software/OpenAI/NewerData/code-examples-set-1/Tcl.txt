Use Case: Tcl (Tool Command Language) is a general-purpose scripting language that's commonly used for web and desktop application development. Tcl is also used for testing, network programming and GUI development.

Code details and examples: Code

Tcl script requires an input file with a '.tcl' extension and Tcl commands inside it.

Sample Input File: script.tcl

Here is an example Tcl script file that prints "Hello, World!" on the console:

```
# Hello World program in Tcl language
puts "Hello, World!"
```

Sample Command to run it:

```
tclsh script.tcl
```

The command `tclsh` runs the Tcl interpreter followed by the filename `script.tcl` to execute your Tcl script.

Another advanced Tcl script example that takes input and uses if-else condition and loop to print numbers:

```
# script.tcl
puts "Please enter a number:"
gets stdin number

if {$number >= 0} {
    puts "You have entered a non-negative number."
    for {set i 0} {$i <= $number} {incr i} {
        puts $i
    }
} else {
    puts "You have entered a negative number."
    for {set i 0} {$i >= $number} {incr i -1} {
        puts $i
    }
}
```

Command to run the script:

```
tclsh script.tcl
```
