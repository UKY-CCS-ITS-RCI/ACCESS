Use Case: Use Redis for data caching to speed up web applications.

Code details and examples: Code

In Python, apart from installing Redis, we also would need to install redis-py, which is a common Python interface to the Redis key-value store.

Here is an example of how to use the SET and GET commands in Redis through Python:

```python
import redis

# Connect to Redis instance
rd = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Set a key
rd.set('name', 'John')

# Get the value of the key
name = rd.get('name')
print(name)  # Outputs: John
```

Command line code to run Redis:

```bash
redis-server
```

Input file: No input file is required. Redis commands are generally written in Python code.

Specifications and Details: 
- For SET command, the key and value is required.
- For GET command, the key is required. 

The Python program communicates with the Redis server using the redis-py's StrictRedis class. The commands are simple: SET command is used to set a Redis key with its value and GET command to retrieve the value of a key.

A connection is established between Python and Redis using `redis.StrictRedis`.

Set a Redis key named 'name' with a value 'John' using `rd.set('name', 'John')`

Retrieve the value of Redis key 'name' using `rd.get('name')`. This returns the value of the key 'name'.
