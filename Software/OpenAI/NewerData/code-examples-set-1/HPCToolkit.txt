Use Case: HPCToolkit is used for measuring and analyzing time/cycles consumed by your program. Its main usage is to provide a detailed view of how resources are being used, call paths in which they occur, and the relation to the program structure.

Code details and examples:

Measurements are typically done as follows:

Code:

```bash
# Perform the measurements
hpcrun -o hpctoolkit-myprog-measurements myprog

# Post process the measurements
hpcstruct hpctoolkit-myprog-measurements

# Generate the database
hpcprof -S myprog.hpcstruct -o mydatabase hpctoolkit-myprog-measurements
```

Review the results:

Code:

```bash
# Launch the hpcviewer GUI
hpcviewer mydatabase
```

In this example, 'myprog' is a binary of the program which you are analyzing.

The output of the measurement command (hpcrun) is a collection of HPCToolkit measurement files, which are fed into hpcstruct for post-processing. The measurement files are then processed by hpcprof to generate a database, which can be analyzed with hpcviewer.

This particular example does not require any specific input file formats, the target for analysis can be any compiled program.
