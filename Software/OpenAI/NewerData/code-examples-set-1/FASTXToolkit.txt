Use Case: The FASTX-Toolkit is a collection of command-line tools for Short-Reads FASTA/FASTQ files preprocessing. 

Code details and examples: 

**Software**: FASTX-Toolkit
**Input file format**: .fasta/.fastaq
**Sample input file name**: example.fastq

fastq_quality_filter tool: It filters the input FASTQ file based on a quality threshold.

Code:
```
fastq_quality_filter -Q33 -q 20 -p 80 -i example.fastq -o example_filtered.fastq
```
The above command filters out reads with less than 80% of the bases with a Phred score less than 20.

fastx_trimmer tool: It trims the input FASTA/FASTQ file into a specified range.

Code:
```
fastx_trimmer -f 1 -l 50 -i example.fastq -o example_trimmed.fastq
```
The above command trims the reads from the first base to the 50th base.

fastx_collapser tool: It collapses identical sequences into a single sequence.

Code:
```
fastx_collapser -i example.fastq -o example_collapsed.fasta
```
The above command collapses identical reads together.

Fastx_reverse_complement tool: It provides the reverse complement of the input FASTA/FASTQ file.

Code:
```
fastx_reverse_complement -i example.fastq -o example_rc.fastq
```
The above command provides the reverse complement of the reads.
