Use Case: Visualization and data analysis of large data sets using an intuitive, user-friendly interface. Paraview can be used in a variety of scientific and engineering scenarios, including computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, and astrophysics simulations. 

Code Details and Examples: Code. 

Paraview does not require writing code, as it provides a graphical user interface. However, it does accept a variety of input formats, including raw binary, ascii text files, and its own VTK format. 

Example of an ascii input file (saved as input.txt):

    # vtk DataFile Version 3.0
    Example grid
    ASCII
    DATASET STRUCTURED_GRID
    DIMENSIONS 3 4 1
    POINTS 12 float
    0 0 0
    1 0 0
    2 0 0
    0 1 0
    1 1 0
    2 1 0
    0 2 0
    1 2 0
    2 2 0
    0 3 0
    1 3 0
    2 3 0

To visualize this file in Paraview, you would go through these steps:

1. Start Paraview.
2. Click on 'File' > 'Open' and select your file.
3. Click on 'Apply' to load the data.
4. Choose an appropriate visualization method (e.g 'Surface' or 'Wireframe').

It's also possible to run Paraview in a batch mode using scripts (Python or pvpython). In this case, an example of a simple script and a command to run it could look like this:

pvpython_script.py:

    from paraview.simple import *

    # Load your data set
    reader = OpenDataFile("input.txt")

    # Create a new 'Render View'
    renderView1 = CreateView('RenderView')

    # Show your data in the 'Render View'
    Show(reader, renderView1)

    # Apply a 'Surface' representation to the data
    SetDisplayProperties(Representation = 'Surface')

    # Start rendering the data
    Render(renderView1)

Command to run it:

    pvpython pvpython_script.py
