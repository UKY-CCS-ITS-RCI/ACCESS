Use Case: RStudio is a comprehensive tool for statistical analysis and graphics. It can be used for data cleaning, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, and all forms of statistical modeling.

Code details and examples: Code 

RStudio reads from a script file (with extension .R) that contains R commands.

Sample script file (my_script.R):

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Read data from input file
data <- read.csv("mydata.csv")

# Perform data analysis (example: calculate mean of Variable_1)
mean_value <- mean(data$Variable_1, na.rm = TRUE)

# Create a plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Variable_1)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Variable 1", y = "Frequency", title = "Histogram of Variable 1")

# Save the plot to an output file
ggsave(filename = "my_plot.png")
```

Specifications for the input file (mydata.csv):

The input file needed for the script above is a CSV (comma separated values) file. This file should contain at least one column named "Variable_1" and can include other columns as well. Missing data should be represented as NA.

Command to run in RStudio:
Open RStudio, set your working directory to the location of your script and data file using the `setwd()` function, and then you can run the script by sourcing the script file.

```R
setwd("/path/to/your/files")
source("my_script.R")
```
This will read the data from "mydata.csv", calculate the mean of "Variable_1", create a histogram, and save the plot as "my_plot.png".
