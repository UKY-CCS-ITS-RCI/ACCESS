Use Case: Aspera is a software toolkit developed by IBM for high-speed data transfer. Typically used for transfer of large data sets over long distances, allowing maximum utilization of bandwidth, regardless of network conditions.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

In Aspera, we often make use of the `ascp` command-line utility. The basic command structure for `ascp` is:

```
ascp [options] source destination
```

The source and destination parameters can be either a single file/directory, or multiple files. 

Here's an example where we transfer a single file from a local machine to a remote machine:

```
ascp -i ~/aspera/cli/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh -Tr -l100m -P33001 -L- file.txt aspera_user@remote.aspera.com:destination_dir/
```

In this example, `~/aspera/cli/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh` is the private key file for authentication, `-Tr` enables resume for the transfer, `-l100m` sets the target transfer rate to 100 Mbps, `-P33001` sets the TCP port for SSH, `-L-` disables logging, `file.txt` is the file to be transferred, and `aspera_user@remote.aspera.com:destination_dir/` is the transfer destination.

File format needed is `.txt` or any other file formats according to the requirement.

Specifications and details in input files: The input file is "file.txt" and it can be any file that needs to be transferred. It is recommended to use full file paths to avoid any confusion. 

Command to run them: As seen in the code snippet, `ascp` is the main command used to initiate the file transfer in Aspera.
