Use Case: GROMACS is used for molecular dynamics simulation, specifically for bio-molecular systems. 

Code details and examples: Code 

To run a GROMACS simulation, you need to have a topology file (.top), a coordinates file (.gro), a molecular dynamics parameters file (.mdp) and possibly an index file (.ndx). 

Here are the basic steps for a simple simulation. 

1. Create a topology file. You could start with an example from the GROMACS site, which includes specifications for the types of atoms, bonds, angles and dihedrals in your system:

```
[ moleculetype ]
; Name            nrexcl
Protein                 3

[ atoms ]
;   nr       type  resnr residue  atom   cgnr     charge       mass  typeB    chargeB      massB
     1   amber99_1      1    ALA      N      1   -0.4157      14.01   ; qtot -0.416
     2   amber99_2      1    ALA      H      1    0.2719      1.008   ; qtot -0.144
```

2. Create a coordinates file. This defines the initial positions and velocities of your atoms:

```
1ALA
    1ALA     N    1   1.064   1.509   1.597  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000
    1ALA     H    2   1.092   1.447   1.634  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000
```

3. Create a .mdp file. This contains the specifications for the MD run, such as the temperature, pressure, time step etc:

```
; Run parameters
integrator               = md
nsteps                   = 5000
dt                       = 0.002

; Output control
nstxout                  = 500
nstvout                  = 500
nstenergy                = 500
nstlog                   = 500
```

4. If required, create an index file. This might be used to specify groups of atoms for analysis or to set up restraints. 

5. Once you have your input files, you would typically first preprocess your topology (.top) and parameters (.mdp) into a binary run input file (.tpr) using the `grompp` command:

Command: `gmx grompp -f md.mdp -c system.gro -p system.top -o run.tpr`

6. This .tpr file is then used as input for the actual simulation run with the `mdrun` command:

Command: `gmx mdrun -v -deffnm run`

In this case, both commands are executed from the terminal. Note that GROMACS commands may start with "gmx" or "gmx_mpi", depending on your GROMACS installation.
