Use Case: GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is often used to compile and run C programs. 

Code details and examples: Code

1. The Sample Input File:
Save this C-program as "hello_world.c". 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   printf("Hello, World!\n");
   return 0;
}
```

2. Specifications and Details in Input Files: 
The file must be a valid C program. 

3. Command to Run the Code:

```
gcc hello_world.c -o output_file
./output_file
```

This first command will compile the c code and the second one will run it.
