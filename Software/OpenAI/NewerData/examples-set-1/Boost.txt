Use Case: Boost is a set of libraries for the C++ programming language that provide support for tasks and structures such as linear algebra, pseudorandom number generation, multithreading, image processing, regular expressions, and unit testing.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```c++
#include <boost/lambda/lambda.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    using namespace boost::lambda;
    typedef std::istream_iterator<int> in;

    std::for_each(
        in(std::cin), in(), std::cout << (_1 * 3) << " " );
}
```
This code includes the necessary Boost headers, and defines a main function that uses Boost's lambda library to define an inline function (_1 * 3) that multiplies each input integer by 3. The for_each function then applies this lambda function to each integer in the range specified (in this case, from the start of stdin to the end), and prints the resulting values.

Format required: This C++ code can be compiled and run on any system with a C++ compiler, Boost installed, and support for standard input/output.

Command to run:

To compile:

`g++ -I /path/to/boost your_file.cpp`

And to run:

`./a.out`
