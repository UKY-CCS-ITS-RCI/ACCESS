Use Case: Automake is a programming tool that is part of the GNU Build System for generating Makefile.in files from files called Makefile.am.

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

1. Create a "Makefile.am" with the following content.

```
bin_PROGRAMS = hello
hello_SOURCES = hello.c
```

This file specifies that we have a single program (hello), and its source file is hello.c. 

2. Create a "configure.ac" - Automakeâ€™s main input, the configure script, is generated from this file which might look as follows:

```
AC_INIT([Hello], [1.0])
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
AC_PROG_CC
AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])
AC_OUTPUT
```

3. Now, generate configuration script using Automake and autoconf:

```
aclocal
automake --add-missing
autoconf
```

4. Configure and build your program:

```
./configure 
make
```

Remember, your program hello.c should be present in the same directory.

Input file: hello.c

Format: C Language Source Code.

Sample Input file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
