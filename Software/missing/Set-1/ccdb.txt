Use Case: Use CCDB for studying cellular architecture and visualizing cellular structures. High-resolution 2D and 3D images allow in depth study of cellular structures. The database provides several types of representations and reconstructions, ranging from simple gallery-like 2D collections to intricate 3D volumes.

Code Details and Examples: Code specifics and sample data vary for each tool within the CCDB. Users can browse the archive and select a dataset of interest to inspect the specific formats and instructions involved. Typically, users can open images in a variety of software tools or download them for offline use.

Command: Commands vary depending on the individual tool or dataset. Refer to the specific tool or dataset documentation for detailed instructions.
