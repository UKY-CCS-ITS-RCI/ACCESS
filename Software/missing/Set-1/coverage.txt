  "Software Name": "Coverage",
  "Overview": "Coverage.py is a Python library that allows users to measure their codeâ€™s coverage. Running your script while wrapped in coverage.py will create a detailed report of what parts of the program were executed.",
  "Core Features": [
    {
      "Command line interface": "Coverage.py provides an easy-to-use command line interface, allowing users to quickly generate comprehensive coverage reports.",
      "Continuous Integration": "The library can be used to continually monitor code coverage and automatically detect and report on any changes.",
      "In-depth reports": "Coverage.py creates detailed reports, highlighting what parts of the code are covered and which are not, helping developers improve their test suite coverage."

Use Case: Use Coverage.py for measuring how much of your Python code is actually covered by your test cases.

Code Details and Examples: Code 

```python
# suppose your test.py file contains your application 
import coverage

cov = coverage.Coverage()
cov.start()

# your code goes here. For example,
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    
cov.stop()
cov.save()

# generate the report
cov.html_report(directory='covhtml')
```

In this example, the coverage.py starts before the application code and stops after it. The data is then saved and an HTML report is generated.

Command: 

```
python your_coverage_script.py
```
