Use Case: deal.II can be used for any domain where complex partial differential equations need to be solved. This can include areas such as aeronautical engineering, civil engineering, computational fluid dynamics among others; 

Code details and examples: Sample code to solve the Poisson problem in 2D using deal.II:
```cpp
#include <deal.II/grid/tria.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/grid_generator.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/grid_out.h>

int main ()
{
  dealii::Triangulation<2> triangulation;
  dealii::GridGenerator::hyper_cube(triangulation);
  triangulation.refine_global (4);

  std::ofstream out ("grid.eps");
  dealii::GridOut grid_out;
  grid_out.write_eps (triangulation, out);
}
```
This code generates a 2D grid of a hypercube and outputs it in EPS format. To compile, use `cmake` and `make` commands accordingly.

For input files, deal.II primarily uses C++ sources with proper header files for defining specific problems.
