Use Case: JupyterLmod is a Jupyter notebook extension which combines Lmod with the interactive computing features of Jupyter. It provides an easy way to interact with environment modules before running notebook cells. JupyterLmod allows users to browse for and activate modules from a dropdown list conveniently located in the Jupyter notebook interface.

Code details and examples: Code.
In the notebook interface, you can browse for available modules by clicking on the "Environment" tab and then the "Module" button. A dropdown list of available modules will appear. Clicking on a module will load it into your environment. You can check the active modules in your environment by typing '!module list' in a cell and then running it.

(Note: The extension must be installed and enabled to use these features. No coding or command line skills are necessary for using this extension.)
