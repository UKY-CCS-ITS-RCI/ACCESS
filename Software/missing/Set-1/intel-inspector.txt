"Software": "Intel Inspector",
"Overview": "Intel Inspector is a dynamic memory and threading error checking tool for users developing serial and multi-threaded applications on Windows and Linux operating systems. It identifies runtime threading and memory errors such as races, deadlocks, and memory leaks that can result in crashes, non-deterministic behaviors and performance degradation.",
"Core Features": 
{
	"Thread Error Analysis": "Identify latent errors and check if different program inputs reveal threading errors.",
	"Memory Error Analysis": "Examine your software for common memory errors including leaks, corruptions and misuses.",
	"Support for Serial Applications": "Create a stable, error-free base before adding parallelism.",
	"Hierarchy of Error Prioritization": "Lets you to quickly resolve issues in order of importance."
