```
Code details and Examples:
``` 
Code: There are no specific code snippets for libcap-devel itself, but it provides the headers necessary to use libcap. A sample usage might be:
#include <sys/capability.h>

cap_t caps;
caps = cap_get_proc();

This would use libcap to get the capabilities of the current process.
Command: To compile software using libcap, you might use a command like gcc -lcap myfile.c
