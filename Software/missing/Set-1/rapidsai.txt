"Software Name": "rapidsai",
"Overview": "RAPIDS is a suite of open source software libraries and APIs gives data scientists the ability to execute end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs.",
"Core Features": [
  "Seamless Integration: RAPIDS integrates straightforwardly into the traditional data science (using familiar interfaces like Numpy and Pandas) to radically accelerate productivity.", 
  "GPU Data Frame: RAPIDS provides a GPU DataFrame library with a familiar Pandas-like API.", 
  "Scalability: RAPIDS directly leverages Apache Arrow for data interchange and adopts the Apache Parquet for efficient and robust I/O."

Use Case: Rapids AI can be used for high performance GPU accelerated Data Analytics and Machine Learning workflows, provides interfaces that are consistent with Pandas, Dask, Scikit-Learn, NetworkX, and others making it simple to adopt;
Code details and examples: Code:

```python
import cudf, io, requests
from io import StringIO

url="https://github.com/plotly/datasets/raw/master/tips.csv"
content = requests.get(url).content.decode('utf-8')

tips_df = cudf.read_csv(StringIO(content))
tips_df['tip_percentage'] = tips_df['tip']/tips_df['total_bill']*100

# display average tip by dining party size
print(tips_df.groupby('size').tip_percentage.mean())
```
In this example, a CSV file is read into a GPU DataFrame and a new feature is created. Then the average 'tip_percentage' is aggregated for each 'size' group.
Command line to run the code: python filename.py  (Replace filename with your file)
