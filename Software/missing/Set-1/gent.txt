    "overview": "Gent is a powerful software used for handling generic entities in a program. It generats C code that manipulates entity structures with any level of complexity. It can handle single structures, arrays of structures, and structures with embedded entities.",
    "core_features": [
        "Entity Manipulation: Create, destroy, copy, compare, hash, print and check entities of any complexity.",
        "Code Generation: Generate C code from entity definitions.",
        "Flexible: Can handle single structures, arrays of structures, and structures with embedded entities.",
        "Supports Symbol Definitions: Generate and use unique identifiers for different entities."
