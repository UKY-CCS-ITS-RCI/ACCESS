Use Case: Use LibSci for performing various numerical computations such as Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS), LAPACK routines, Sparse BLAS operations, and Fast Fourier transforms in a High Performance Computing context.

Code details and examples:

Input file: None required

Command to run:
Assuming a Cray environment with the PrgEnv-cray programming environment loaded, you can compile a Fortran source file myfile.F with LibSci as follows:
```Bash
ftn -o myexe myfile.F -lsci
```
In this command, `-o myexe` specifies the output file, `myfile.F` is the Fortran source file, and `-lsci` links the LibSci library.

Code snippet:
Here is a minimal Fortran code snippet that uses the  LIBSCI BLAS routine SGEMM to perform a matrix multiply operation:
```Fortran
PROGRAM MAIN
   REAL A(5,5), B(5,5), C(5,5)
   INTEGER I, J
   DO I=1,5
       DO J=1,5
           A(I,J) = I - J
           B(I,J) = I + J
           C(I,J) = 0.0
       ENDDO
   ENDDO
   CALL SGEMM('N','N',5,5,5,1.0,A,5,B,5,0.0,C,5)
END PROGRAM MAIN
```
In this code, `SGEMM` is a LIBSCI subroutine for multiplying matrices. The arguments `'N','N'` specify no operation, `5,5,5` are the dimensions of the matrices, and `1.0` is the scalar factor. The `-lsci` flag specifies linking with the LIBSCI library.

Remember to compile with `-lsci` flag to use LIBSCI routines.
