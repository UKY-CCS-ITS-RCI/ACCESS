Use case: OpenSHMEMX can be used in various HPC and parallel computing applications, including scientific computing, simulations, data analytics, machine learning, and more. It is suitable for applications that need fast and efficient inter-node communication with shared memory.

Code details and examples: Code example for a simple data transfer using OpenSHMEMX:

```
#include <shmemx.h>
int main(void) {
  shmemx_init();
  int old_val = shmemx_int_atomic_fetch_add(&remote, 1, PE);
  shmemx_finalize();
  return 0;
}
```

A typical compilation and execution command of an OpenSHMEMX program might look like this:

```
$ oshcc hello_world.c
$ oshrun -np 4 ./a.out
```
