Use Case: Use Intel IPP Intel64 for high-performance computing applications, typically in signal processing, image processing, or computer vision.
Code:
```python
# Includes optional function-specific prefixes for easy search
from scipy import signal
from ipp import ipp
import numpy as np

# Input data
data = np.random.random(10000)
window = signal.gaussian(50, std=7)

# Filtering function
ippResult = ipp.ippFilter(data, window)
```
The command to run the code snippet:
```
python3 script.py
```
The input data in this sample Python script is a random array of 10000 floating-point numbers, and the filter window is a Gaussian window of 50 points with a standard deviation of 7.
