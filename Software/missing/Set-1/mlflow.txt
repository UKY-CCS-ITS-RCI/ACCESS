Use Case: Use mlflow to train a linear regression model, track its metrics, save the model and then load it for prediction.

Code Details and Examples: 
```
Code:

import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn import linear_model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the diabetes dataset
diabetes = datasets.load_diabetes()
X = diabetes.data
y = diabetes.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Instantiate and train the model
lr = linear_model.LinearRegression()
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)

# Calculate metrics
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

with mlflow.start_run():

    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(lr, 'model')

    # Log metrics
    mlflow.log_metric('mse', mse)

# To load the model for prediction later
lr_loaded = mlflow.sklearn.load_model('runs:/<run_id>/model')
```
Command to run: Python3 your_script.py (replace 'your_script.py' with the name of your python script file)

You need to replace <run_id> with the specific id of the run that got printed out while logging the model in the previous steps.
