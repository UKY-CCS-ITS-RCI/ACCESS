    "Software Name": "xcb-util-image",
    "Comprehensive Overview": "Xcb-util-image is a tool that provides functions for manipulating images used in the X window system. It also allows you to handle and manage the X clipboard or cut buffers. Xcb-util-image is part of the XCB protocol bindings for X Window System protocol in C language. It is essential in providing interoperability between the Xlib and XCB libraries, thereby facilitating a gradual transition from Xlib to XCB.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Provides high-level XKB API",
        "Allows for colorization of cursors from images",
        "Offers icccm helpers in operating window manager",
        "Provides utility functions for EWMH handling",
        "Aids in the computation of maximum request length"
