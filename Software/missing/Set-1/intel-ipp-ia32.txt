Code details and examples: 

Code:
```
#include 'ipp.h'
main()
{ 
    Ipp64f pSrc[3] = {1000, 2000, 3000};
    Ipp64f pDst[3];
    ippsLn_64f_A53 (pSrc, pDst, 3);
}
```
Command to run: g++ filename.cpp; then by running the resultant executable.

Here, Intel IPP's natural logarithm function 'ippsLn_64f_A53' is being used to calculate the natural logarithm of the values in the array 'pSrc' and store the result in the array 'pDst'. The function 'ippsLn_64f_A53' is a part of the Mathematics functions provided by Intel IPP.

Input File Specifications: The code example provided does not require an input file. It operates on an array of double 'pSrc' that is initialized in the code. Intel IPP functions can process data from various sources and formats - from direct memory arrays like in this example to data from files or images depending on the particular function and use case in question.
