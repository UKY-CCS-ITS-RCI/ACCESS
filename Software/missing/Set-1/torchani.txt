"Software Name": "TorchANI",
"Overview": "TorchANI is a pytorch-based package for molecular simulations using projective quantum mechanical (PQM) methods. It is a part of the ANI project, which aims to integrate PQM methods and deep learning to accelerate materials science research.",
"Core Features": 
[
    "Support for PyTorch: TorchANI is built with pytorch, bringing GPU support and seamless integration with other pytorch-based machine learning tools.",
    "ANI Models: TorchANI includes pre-trained ANI models that can be used for molecular dynamics simulations.",
    "Modularity: The API is designed to be modular to facilitate use of TorchANI's components with non-ANI forcefields or other custom model architectures."

Code Details and Examples:

Use case: Calculate Energy and forces for a molecule with TorchANI

Code:

```python
import torch
import torchani

# Create ANI model
model = torchani.models.ANI2x()

# Convert coordinates to tensor
coordinates = torch.tensor([[[0,0,0], [0,0,1.1], [0,1.1,1.1]]], requires_grad=True)

# Specify species
species = torch.tensor([[6, 8, 1]])

# Calculate energy and forces
energy = model((species, coordinates)).energies

# Use automatic differentiation to get forces
forces = -torch.autograd.grad(energy.sum(), coordinates)[0]

```

The molecule specified is a carbon, oxygen and hydrogen atom arranged in a triangle. The coordinates are given in ångström.

Command to run:

```bash
python script.py
```
