Use Case: Use pax-utils when you need to deal with pe-format files in a package building process or when investigating properties and contents of ELF files.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code: 
In the most basic use case, you can use pax-utils to list the contents of an ELF file:

```bash
scanelf -e /path/to/binary
```

You can also use pax-utils to check the health of ELF files:

```bash
scanelf -e /path/to/binary | grep "<bad>"
```

If you have a .pax file and you want to extract it, you can use pax-utils:

```bash
paxctl -x /path/to/archive.pax
```

Please note, you need to replace "/path/to/binary" and "/path/to/archive.pax" with the path to your actual files.
