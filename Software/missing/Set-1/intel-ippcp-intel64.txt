Use Case: The Intel Integrated Performance Primitive for Cryptography Primitives (intel-ippcp-intel64) library is a software package that allows developers to build software applications involving cryptographic operations on Intel-supported platforms, particularly ed64-based systems. 

Code details and examples:

```c
#include "ippcp.h"

void main() {
    IppsBigNumState* aBN;
    const int aLen = 256;

    // Memory allocation for the big number
    Ipp8u* pA = (Ipp8u*) malloc(aLen * sizeof(Ipp8u));

    // Creating the big number
    ippsBigNumInit(aLen, &aBN);

    // Setting value for the big number
    ippsSetOctString_BN(pA, aLen, aBN);
}
```
In this example, a BigNum value is created and initialized. 

Command: The command to run heavily depends on the specific use case and environment setup, but generally involves linking `ippcp.h` in your C program and compiling with the Intel Compiler or GCC.
