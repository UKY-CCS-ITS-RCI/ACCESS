}

Use Case: 
MRnet is extensively used for classifying Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to predict knee injuries such as Anterior Cruciate Ligament(ACL) tears, meniscal tears, etc. 

Code Details and Examples:
Code:

```
from model.MRNet import MRNet
model = MRNet()
```

Input File Format:
The input file format required by MRNet is NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) which is commonly used for storing MRI data.

Command to Run:
The command to run an MRNet model after it's been defined and the data is loaded could be `model.fit(train_loader, epochs, valid_loader)`
