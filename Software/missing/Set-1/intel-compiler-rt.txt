Use Case: Use the Intel Compiler Runtime to enhance the performance of a C++ application running on an Intel processor.

Code Details and Examples: Example code cannot be provided as the Intel Compiler Runtime is a utility that operates in the background to enhance the performance of other applications.

Command to run: There is no direct command to run the Intel Compiler Runtime as it is a support library for the Intel Compiler. It serves to enhance the performance of applications compiled with the Intel Compiler.
