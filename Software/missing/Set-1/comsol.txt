"Use Case": "COMSOL is used extensively in scientific and engineering fields for simulating and optimizing physical systems. It can be used to simulate fluid flow in a pipe, heat transfer in a heat exchanger, vibrations in a structure, electric field in a capacitor, magnetic field in a transformer, particle diffusion in a cell, etc.; In business, it is used for product development, improving product performance or even prototyping new product ideas.",
  
"Code Details and Examples": "As COMSOL is a graphical user interface software, it primarily works through a point-and-click method rather than traditional coding. Models are built using physics interfaces available in various modules, parameters are set for the problem, and the equations are solved numerically."
