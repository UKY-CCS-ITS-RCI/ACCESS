Use Case: Use the Intel Compiler for developing high-performance software applications that can efficiently run on various Intel hardware like Intel Core processors, Intel Xeon Scalable processors, or Intel Xeon Phi processors. ; Code details and examples: Code would vary depending upon the programming language and usage scenario. For C programming, the usage could be as follows: `icc -O2 -o hello_world hello_world.c` where `-O2` is the optimization level, `-o` specifies the output file name and `hello_world.c` is the source file to compile.
