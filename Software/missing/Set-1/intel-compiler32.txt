Use Case: 
Use ; Intel Compiler 32 can be used in compiling a C++ application that utilizes SIMD operations provided by Intel processors.

Code Details and Examples: 
Code ; Assuming a simple C++ hello world application, the main.cxx source file is:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
    return 0;
}
```
The command to compile this with Intel Compiler 32 is: `icpc -o hello main.cxx`
