"Software": "methylpy",
"Overview": "Methylpy is a python package specifically designed for analyzing bisulfite sequencing data (BS-seq, RRBS, NOMe-seq etc.) at both global and locus-specific levels. It supports parallel computation and is capable of dealing with the large data inherent in methylation research.",
"Core Features": [
"Perform end-to-end methylation analyses.",
"Differential methylation analysis.",
"Methylation calls for individual loci.",
"Support for various methylation sequencing techniques.",
"Support for parallel computation.",
"Integration with data visualization tools."
