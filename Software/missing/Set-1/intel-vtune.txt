Use Case: Use VTune Profiler to identify the high computation function in a multthreaded application

Code details and examples:
Code:
```python
def compute_high(arg1, arg2):
    # High computation function
    pass

def main():
    # multithreaded function call
    # Use VTune Profiler here to identify performance of function
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Command to run: 
```bash
vtune -collect hotspots -knob sampling-mode=hw -app-working-dir /path/to/project -- python3 /path/to/project/main.py
```
requires the application to be profiled to be run with VTune Profiler command line tool.
