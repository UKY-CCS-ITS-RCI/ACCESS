Software Name: Git

{
  "Software Name": "Git",
  "Overview": "Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It helps developers to maintain the history of project file edits, coordinates work that multiple people can do on the same project files, and manages and narrows down the impact of conflicts in the project development.",
  "Core Features": [
    {
      "Feature": "Distributed System",
      "Description": "Every user essentially has a full backup of the main server. Each clone includes a full copy of all the data of a project."
    },
    {
      "Feature": "Branching and Merging",
      "Description": "The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every other SCM is its branching model. Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other."
    },
    {
      "Feature": "Small and Fast",
      "Description": "Git is incredibly fast, as it is written in C. It also maintains small project size by utilizing compression and storing only differences."
    },
    {
      "Feature": "Security",
      "Description": "Git is designed with strong cryptographic methods to secure project history and authentication."
    },
    {
      "Feature": "Staging Area",
      "Description": "Unlike the commit process in other VCSs, Git provides a staging area to format and review a set of changes before the commit process."
    }
  ],
  "Tags": ["Version Control", "SCM", "Distributed System", "Open Source", "Coding", "Programming", "Development"]

Use Case: Use: Git can be used for managing a digital content version, particularly source codes of software or web development. It allows coordinated multi-person work on that digital content to manage and narrow down disagreements in the project development, safeguard project history, and secure user identification and authentication.

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

- To set up Git, use the command
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@domain.com"
```

- To initialize Git in a directory,
```bash
git init
```

- To clone a repository,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

- To stage all changes in the directory for the next commit,
```bash
git add .
```

- To commit staged changes,
```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

- To push changes to the remote repository,
```bash
git push origin master
```

- To pull changes from the remote repository,
```bash
git pull origin master
```
