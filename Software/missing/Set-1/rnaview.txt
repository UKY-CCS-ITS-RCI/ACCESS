Code Details and Examples:

Use case: To analyze and view the secondary structure of a DNA or RNA sequence. 

Code:

```bash
# Assuming RNAView is already installed and your input PDB file is 'input.pdb'
rnaview input.pdb output.txt
```

The input file should be in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format. The command will generate a 'output.txt' file which contains the geometric classification of base pairs and the base stacking positions.
