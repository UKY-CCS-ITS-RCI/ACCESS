Use Case:
Use STAR-Fusion for fusion gene detection in RNA-seq data.

Code details and examples:

Code to run STAR-Fusion:

```
STAR --genomeDir /path/to/your/STAR-index  \
--readFilesIn sample_1.fastq sample_2.fastq \
--outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate \
--readFilesCommand zcat \
--outFileNamePrefix star
```

For this, you will need two files: sample_1.fastq and sample_2.fastq, which are your raw sequence data. Note that "/path/to/your/STAR-index" should be the path to your STAR index directory.

After that, you can run STAR-Fusion with:
```
STAR-Fusion --genomeDir /path/to/your/STAR-index \
--left_fq sample_1.fastq \
--right_fq sample_2.fastq \
--output_dir star_fusion_outdir
```

For this, you will need the same raw sequence data, and an output directory where the results will be saved. Note that "/path/to/your/STAR-index" should be the path to your STAR index directory.
