Software name: Allocations

Comprehensive Overview: Allocations is a highly efficient open-source tool/architecture designed for managing resource allocation in computer systems, focusing on optimizing resource usage in high-performance computing or in end-to-end service environments. The software helps to organize, prioritize and allocate computing resources for efficient utilization.

Core Features: 
1. Efficient Resource Management: Helps to manage and distribute resources effectively amongst various computing tasks.
2. Flexibility: Provides numerous adjustment parameters to accommodate different resource allocation strategies.
3. Prioritization: Allows for resource prioritization, ensuring important tasks are given the required processing power.
4. Advanced Scheduling: Works in tandem with job schedulers to optimize resource usage.

General Tags: Resource allocation, computer systems management, optimization, high-performance computing.

Use Case: 

Use ;
Allocations is often used in high-performance computing environments where resources need to be efficiently managed and allocated among various tasks. This includes tasks like scientific simulations, complex data analysis and high-powered computation.

Code details and examples:

Code;
To illustrate a simple use case of Allocations:

Suppose we have a computing environment with N resources (CPUs, memory etc.) and we want to allocate these resources to M tasks.

In an Allocation tool config file, it may appear as such,

```
{
    "resources": N,
    "tasks": M,
    "allocationStrategy": "priority"
}
```
Then to run allocations with this configuration:
```
./allocations --config config.json
```
The allocationStrategy parameter defines the method to use for allocating the tasks.
