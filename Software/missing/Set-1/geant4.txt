Use Case: Use Geant4 to simulate a particle being tracked through a complex detector system.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Create a detector:

```
G4VPhysicalVolume* DetectorConstruction::Construct()
{
  // define a box
  G4Box* myBox = new G4Box("Box",10*cm,10*cm,10*cm);
  
  // define logical volume
  G4LogicalVolume* myBox_log = new G4LogicalVolume(myBox,Ar,"Box_log");
  
  // placement of Box
  G4VPhysicalVolume* myBox_phys =
       new G4PVPlacement(0,G4ThreeVector(),myBox_log,"Box",0,false,0);
  
  return myBox_phys;
}
```

Understand outputs of energy deposit:

```
G4cout << "Total energy deposit in calorimeter : " 
       << fEdep/MeV << " MeV" << G4endl;
```

Command: 

To run simulation, typically, bash scripts are used like so:

```
$ cd $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM
$ ./exampleB1
```

**Note:** Actual simulation setup will vary greatly project to project. This is a very basic example.
