Code Details & Examples:
Code: 
```python
# Python code for a simple AI model using the Scikit-learn library
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

iris_data = datasets.load_iris()

X = iris_data.data
y = iris_data.target

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.4, random_state=1)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

prediction = model.predict(X_test)
```
Command to Run: python3 ai_model.py

Input File Specifications: Not Required. The libraries used in this code load in-built datasets. If you want to use your own datasets, you can pass your CSV data file in the form of pandas DataFrame to the model.
