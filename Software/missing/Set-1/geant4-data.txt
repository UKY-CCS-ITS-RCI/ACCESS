Software Name: Geant4-data

Comprehensive Overview:
Geant4-data is a software package specifically designed to run with the Geant4 simulations tool, a software toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter. It is used by a variety of scientific fields including high energy, nuclear and accelerator physics, as well as studies in medical and space science.

Core Features:
- Collection of databases for Geant4 toolkit
- Essential for modeling interactions of particles with matter
- Manages data for nuclear and atomic interactions

Code details and examples:

Use Case: 

Use Geant4-data for modeling interactions of particles with matter. This becomes critical in assessing the effects of radiation on materials or particles' behavior in space and related fields. 

Code:

The Geant4-data isn't directly run. Instead, it is used by the Geant4 simulations. For instance, a sample simulation script might look similar to below:

```
#include "G4RunManager.hh"
#include "G4UImanager.hh"

#include "G4VisExecutive.hh"
#include "G4UIExecutive.hh"

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    G4RunManager* runManager = new G4RunManager;
 
    G4VisManager* visManager = new G4VisExecutive;
    visManager->Initialize();

    G4UIExecutive* ui = new G4UIExecutive(argc, argv);
    G4UImanager* UImanager = G4UImanager::GetUIpointer();
    UImanager->ApplyCommand("/control/execute init_vis.mac");

    ui->SessionStart();

    delete ui;
    delete visManager;
    delete runManager;
}
```
Here Geant4-data is used as a supplementary database for Geant4 which is used to model a variety of physical processes.
