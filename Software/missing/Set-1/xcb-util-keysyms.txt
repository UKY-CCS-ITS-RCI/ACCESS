    "Software": "xcb-util-keysyms",
    "Overview": "xcb-util-keysyms is a library that provides convenient access to XCB for using X keysym definitions. It's a part of the xcb-util module which provides several libraries that sit on top of libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension libraries.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Provides API for keysym definitions",
        "Standing interface to the X server",
        "Usable extensions for libxcb"
    ],
    "Tags": ["XCB", "Keysyms", "Library"]

}

Use Case: Use xcb-util-keysyms when you need to interact with X keysym definitions in a X server environment.

Code details and examples: Code snippets might look like this:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <xcb/xcb.h>
#include <xcb/xcb_keysyms.h>

void handle_key_press(xcb_key_press_event_t *ev) {
  xcb_keysym_t keysym = xcb_key_press_lookup_keysym(keysyms, ev, 0);

  switch (keysym) {
    case XCB_KEY_Up: printf("Up key was pressed\n"); break;
    case XCB_KEY_Down: printf("Down key was pressed\n"); break;
    default: printf("Other key was pressed\n");
  }
}
```

To compile this code in a Unix-based system you might use something like: `gcc main.c -lxcb -lxcb-keysyms -o myprogram`.
