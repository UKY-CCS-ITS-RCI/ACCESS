  "Software": "Flowcharts",
  "Overview": "Flowcharts is a software tool used for designers, engineers, and project managers in creating a graphical representation to depict the steps involved in a process in the form of diagrams. This process presents a roadmap for optimal problem-solving.",
  "Core Features": [
    "Process Design and Analysis: This helps in creating a sequence of steps to solve a problem or execute a task.",
    "Collaboration: This feature allows multiple users to work simultaneously on a chart.",
    "Export/Import: The flowcharts can be exported and imported in various formats such as MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel etc.",
    "Drag and Drop Interface: This tool features a drag-and-drop editor for creating flowcharts with ease.",
    "Routing Paths: It automatically connects flow shapes and objects with lines or 'routes' based on their relation."

Use case:
Flowcharts can be utilized to break down complex processes, like project management, design planning, and engineering tasks. 

Code details and examples:

Flowcharts doesn't usually involve code snippets as it's more of a graphical tool. However, the typical steps involved in creating a flowchart are as follows:

1. Open the Flowcharts software.
2. Choose a predefined template or start from scratch.
3. Drag and drop shapes or symbols onto your chart.
4. Connect the shapes using lines to represent the flow of the process.
5. Label each shape and line as necessary to describe the process.
6. Save or export your flowchart as necessary.
