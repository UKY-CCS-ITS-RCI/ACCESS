"Software": "readline-devel",
"Overview": "readline-devel is a software package that provides the libraries and header files required to develop applications that use the readline functionality. Readline provides a set of functions for use by applications that allow users to edit command lines. A line editing interface both for interactive and non-interactive programs is provided via these libraries",
"Core Features": [
  {
    "Editable command lines": "Readline allows users to edit command lines, providing a user interface for text input.",
    "History functions": "Readline provides functions to remember previously entered command lines.",
    "Completion functions": "The software also offers capabilities for programmable completion, allowing for custom autocomplete functionality.",
    "Key binding": "It allows for customizable key-bindings, providing flexibility for interaction."

Use Case: readline-devel is primarily used in the development of various applications that require command line editing functionality. It provides a set of functions to applications to allow users to edit command lines as if they were using a text editor. During data feeds, this feature allows for easy manipulation and modifications for the operators.

Code Details and Examples: 
Code: 
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <readline/readline.h>
#include <readline/history.h>

int main()
{
    char* line = readline("Enter a line: ");
    if (line != NULL) {
        printf("You entered: %s\n", line);
        free(line);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
In this simple example, readline-devel is used to provide basic interactive command line input functionality in a C program. Once you have included needed headers, you can use readline() function call to read user input from command line.
