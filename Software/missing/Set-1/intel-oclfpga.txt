  "Software Name": "Intel OCLFPGA",
  "Overview": "Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL is a suite of OpenCL application development tools optimized for Intel FPGA devices. This suite allows a software programmer to write programs that can run on a wide range of devices, including FPGAs, using a single high-level language. It encapsulates all the required functionality to compose an OpenCL application into a single, intuitive graphical user interface.",
  "Core Features": {
    "Broad Hardware Suppor": "Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL provides broad support for FPGA devices, enabling programming of a variety of FPGA devices in OpenCL.",
    "High-level Programming": "Regardless of the underlying hardware architecture, developers can write once and run on a variety of FPGA devices.",
    "Graphical Interface": "Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL provides a streamlined user interface for intuitive navigation of the OpenCL development process."

Use Case: 
Use: Writing optimized programs for FPGA devices in OpenCL, running simulations, and testing.

Code details and examples: 
Code: 
```
__kernel void HelloWorld(__global *mem) 
{
  mem[get_global_id(0)] = get_global_id(0);
}
```
This sample OpenCL kernel will write the current global ID to the corresponding index in global memory.

Command to run: 
```
aoc -v device/HelloWorld.cl -o bin/HelloWorld.aocx
```
This will compile an OpenCL program to run on an Intel FPGA.

Note: The input files in OpenCL are generally .cl files, written in OpenCL C, a restricted subset of the C programming language.
