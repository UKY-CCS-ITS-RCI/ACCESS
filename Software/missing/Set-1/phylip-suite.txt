Use Case: PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) is a free computational package that performs a variety of functionalities in inferring phylogenies. This suite of programs has functions for performing multiple sequence alignments, drawing phylogenetic trees, inferring evolutionary relationships, and other tasks related to phylogenetics. These programs have a broad range of applications in the fields of molecular biology, genomics, and evolutionary biology.

Code details and examples: Code:

PHYLIP consists of several stand-alone tools. Here is an example of using Phylip's "dnaml" program:

```bash
# Create an alignment file in PHYLIP format
cat >infile <<EOF
5 42
Turkey  AAGCTNGGGC ATTTCAGGGT
Salmo g AAGCCTTGGC AGTTCGGGGT
Homo sa AAGCCTTGGC ATTTCGAGGT
Chimp   AAGCTTTTGC ATTTCAGGGT
Gorilla AAGCTNTGGC AGTTCGAGGT
EOF

# Run dnaml
dnaml

# The result is saved in a file named "outtree".
```
For PHYLIP, input data usually comes in a very specific format. The input dataset must start with a single line indicating the number of sequences and the number of base pairs in the sequences. Following this, each sequence must be exactly on a line in the file with its respective identifier.
