Use Case:
Use: TIGER is prominently used in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for tasks like urban planning, traffic management, and asset tracking.

Code details and examples:
Code:
Unfortunately, TIGER isn't a programmable software or does not offer any command-line usage. It only provides data files in shapefile (.shp, .shx, .dbf) and Geodatabase formats which can be used with different GIS software like ArcGIS, Quantum GIS etc.
