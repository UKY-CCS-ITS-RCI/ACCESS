    "Software Name": "CheckM",
    "Overview": "CheckM is a software tool for assessing the quality of genomes recovered from isolates, single cells, or metagenomes computationally. It provides robust estimates of the completeness and contamination of draft genomes.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Robustly estimate the completeness and contamination of genomic bins.",
        "Estimate the proportion of reads aligning to a set of marker genes contained within a bin.",
        "Assess the phylogenetic position of a bin.",
        "Estimate strain heterogeneity based on the variance of coverage profiles."
    ],

Use Case: CheckM can be used to provide detailed reports on the completeness and contamination of a draft genome for quality assessment in genomics research. For example, in a metagenomics study where microbial genomes are being assembled, CheckM can help to ensure the highest quality genomic bins are selected.

Code Details and Examples:  

Code:
```
# To run CheckM
checkm lineage_wf /path/to/draft_genomes /path/to/output_folder
```
Input file format: CheckM accepts genome sequences in fasta format. Each file should contain a single genome or genomic bin.

Command: `checkm lineage_wf /path/to/draft_genomes /path/to/output_folder`
This command will run the lineage-specific workflow on your genomes, outputting the results to the specified folder.
