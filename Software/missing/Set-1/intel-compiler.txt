Use Case:
Intel Compiler is a versatile set of software development tools that includes compilers, libraries, and more for boosting the performance of software applications. Designed by Intel Corporation, this compiler is primarily used with high-performance computing (HPC) environments to streamline software development by optimizing code, reducing bugs, and providing quicker coding capabilities.

Code details and examples:

Code:
```
#include<stdio.h>//header file 

int main() { //main function
    printf("Hello world\n"); 
    return 0; 
}
```

When using Intel Compiler, you typically save this code in a .c file and then utilize the icc or icpc command to compile the code. Here's how to do it:

```
$ icc hello.c -o hello
$ ./hello
```

Output:
```
Hello world
```
