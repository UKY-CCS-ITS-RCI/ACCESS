Use Case: 
Use Jupyter Notebook to perform data cleaning and transformation on a given dataset. Once cleaned, apply various statistical modelling algorithms to analyze the data and draw insights. Finally visualize the results for reporting and decision making.

Code details and examples: 
Code:
```python 
import pandas as pd 
dataset = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv') 
dataset.head() 
```
