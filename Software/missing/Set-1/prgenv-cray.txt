Use Case: 
PrgEnv-cray is typically used in high-performance computing environments where there's a need for efficient utilization of large-scale systems and multi-threaded architectures. It offers a productive environment for developers working on scientific applications, data-intensive applications, simulations, and machine learning workloads. 

Code Details and Examples: 
Code: 
Here is a brief example of using PrgEnv-cray to compile and run a Fortran code. 

```bash
module load PrgEnv-cray
ftn -o my_program my_program.f90
aprun -n 32 ./my_program
```

Here, `module load PrgEnv-cray` loads the PrgEnv-cray environment, `ftn` is the Fortran compiler provided by Cray, `-o my_program` specifies the output executable's name, and `my_program.f90` is the source code file. The `aprun` command is used to execute the compiled code across multiple processor cores, with `-n 32` specifying the number of cores to use.
