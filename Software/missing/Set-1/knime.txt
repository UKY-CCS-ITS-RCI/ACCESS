Code Details and Examples:

Use Case: Perform statistical analysis on a dataset

Code:
In the KNIME analytics platform, the analysis is performed through a visual workflow. For instance, to perform statistical analysis:
1. Import the dataset using the 'File Reader' node.
2. Connect the 'Data to Report' node to the 'File Reader' node, which allows the generation of a statistical report on the data.
3. Execute the workflow.
Note: This is a simplified workflow. KNIME allows complex workflows with multiple analytical methods applied on the data.

Command to Run: As a GUI-based tool, workflows in KNIME are executed within the platform itself by selecting Execute > After Reset.
