  "Software": "Arriba",
  "Overview": "Arriba is a command-line tool for the detection of gene fusions from paired-end RNA-Seq data. It was developed for the use in a clinical research context. The main advantages of Arriba over other tools are a good balance between speed and sensitivity, outstanding specificity (i.e., few false positives), and the visualization of fusions in automatically generated PDFs.",
  "Core Features": [
    "Detection of gene fusions, circular RNAs, internal tandem duplications",
    "Automatically created visualization of detected gene fusions",
    "Requires only moderate computational resources",
    "Blacklist filtering to remove recurrent false positives",
    "Discovery mode for novel events"
  ],

Use Case: The researchers want to detect gene fusions from a paired-end RNA-Seq data. 

Code details and examples:

Code: 
```bash
   arriba \
   -x fusions.bam \
   -o fusions.tsv \
   -O fusions.discarded.tsv \
   -a assembly.fa \
   -g genes.gtf \
   -b blacklist.tsv
```

Sample input files:
The input files for Arriba consist of aligned reads in BAM format (fusions.bam), a genome assembly file (assembly.fa), a GTF file describing gene annotations (genes.gtf), and a blacklist file of recurrent false positives (blacklist.tsv)
