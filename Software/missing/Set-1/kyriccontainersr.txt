Use Case: Use ; Analyze data using R scripts in a portable, containerized environment.
Code details and examples: Code ; Write an R script analysing your data.
```
## R Script (analyse.R)
data <- read.csv('data.csv')
summary <- summary(data)
write.csv(summary, 'summary.csv')
```
Then, create a Dockerfile to bundle your R script with the R container.
```
## Dockerfile
FROM kyric/r:latest
COPY analyse.R /analyse.R
CMD Rscript /analyse.R
```
Finally, build and run the Docker container.
```
docker build -t my-analysis .
docker run -v $(pwd):/data my-analysis
```
