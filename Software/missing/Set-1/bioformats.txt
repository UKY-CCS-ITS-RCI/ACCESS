  "Software": "Bio-Formats",
  "Overview": "Bio-Formats is a Java library for reading and writing life sciences image file formats. It is developed by the Open Microscopy Environment (particularly UW-Madison LOCI). Bio-Formats is capable of parsing both pixels and metadata for a large number of formats, as well as writing to several formats.",
  "Core Features": [
    {
            "Read": "Provides the ability to parse metadata and pixel data from over 130 file formats.",
            "Write": "Enables writing to several formats and shuffling of pixel data to any ordering.",
            "Metadata": "Converts file metadata to OME-XML and has ability to interpret most native metadata formats.",
            "Flexibility": "Bio-Formats is also modular, allowing for certain parts of a file to be read without relying on other parts."

Use Case: 
Use: Reading and parsing a life sciences image file.

Code Details and Examples:
Code: 
```
import loci.formats.in.DefaultMetadataOptions;
import loci.formats.in.MetadataLevel;
...

metadataOptions = new DefaultMetadataOptions(MetadataLevel.ALL);
reader.setMetadataOptions(metadataOptions);
```
This example shows how to use Bio-Formats to parse an image file.

Command to run the above code depends on the specific Java IDE or command line tool being used.
