Use Case:
Use: Intel DAAL can be used in machine learning tasks. It speeds up big data analysis by providing highly optimized algorithmic building blocks for all data analysis stages (Preprocessing, Transformation, Analysis, Modeling, Validation, and Decision Making) for offline, streaming and distributed analytics usages. It's particularly useful in financial technology, health technology, scientific research, and energy sectors where large scale data analysis is required.

Code details and examples:
Code:

```python
from daal.data_management import (
   DataSourceIface, FileDataSource, HomogenNumericTable
)

datasetFileName = 'path_to_your_file.csv'

# Initialize FileDataSource<CSVFeatureManager> to retrieve the input data
# from a .csv file
dataSource = FileDataSource(
   datasetFileName,
   DataSourceIface.notAllocateNumericTable,
   DataSourceIface.doDictionaryFromContext
)
```

Command to run:
```bash
python script.py
```
