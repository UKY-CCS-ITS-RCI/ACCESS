    "Software Name": "fastq-tools",
    "Comprehensive Overview": "Fastq-tools is a software package that provides a set of utilities for short-read sequencing data; it manipulates FASTQ files types, which are often used in genomics to represent sequencing reads and their respective quality scores. Tools include manipulating sequences, computing quality statistics and filtering reads.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Fast and efficient processing of FASTQ files.",
        "Simple to use command line interface which adheres to Unix principles.",
        "Comprehensive tools collection for performing commonly required operations on FASTQ files.",
        "Ability to manipulate sequences and quality scores.",
        "Computation of quality statistics.",
        "Performing simple filtration of reads."

Use Case: Fastq-tools helps in the manipulation and operation fastq format sequencing files; 

Code details and examples: Each tool is designed to do one job in a flexible, efficient manner. Given below are examples of two core features. 

/*Code1: Manipulating sequences*/
/*fastq-grep is used to match sequences*/
fastq-grep 'TGGGGAAT' in.fastq > out.fastq

/*Code2 : Computing quality statistics*/
/*fastq-quality computes quality statistics across all reads*/
fastq-quality in.fastq > quality.txt

Command to run them : 
fastq-grep 'TGGGGAAT' in.fastq > out.fastq
fastq-quality in.fastq > quality.txt

Input file Format : 
The software takes input in FASTQ format files which include sequence information and their quality scores. The file normally contains four lines per sequence.
