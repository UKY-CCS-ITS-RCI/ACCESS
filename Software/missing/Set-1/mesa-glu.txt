  "Software Name": "mesa-glu",
  "Prodcut Overview":"mesa-glu is an implementation of the OpenGL utility library (GLU). GLU is not part of core OpenGL, and its functions are from GLU 1.3. The mesa-glu is an open-source software developed by volunteers to provide the implementation.",
  "Core Features": [
    "Creates and draws geometry",
    "Manipulates quadric shapes",
    "Supports Non-uniform rational B-Spline (NURBS)"
  ],
  "General Tags": [
    "OpenGL",
    "Graphics",
    "Library",
    "Open Source"
