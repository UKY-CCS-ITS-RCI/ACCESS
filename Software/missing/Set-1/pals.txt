  "Overview": "Pathway Activity Level Scoring (PALS) is a software applied for metabolomics data analysis and biological interpretation. PALS employs pathway topology information to calculate pathway activity and provides quantitative information about pathways and metabolites, enabling researchers to focus on key metabolic changes.",

Use Case: Use the PALS software package to analyze a given metabolomics dataset. The input data required is a metabolite dataset that is fully annotated with respect to KEGG compound identifiers, which PALS uses to perform pathway analyses. The data should be in a tab-separated format.

Code details and examples: Code -

# Import necessary libraries
from pals.pals import PALS
from pals.feature_extraction import DataSource
from pals.pathway_analysis import PALS

# Load the sample data
data_source = DataSource('example_data/gnps_positive_ionmode_cleaned_by_matchms_and_lookups.csv')

# Perform the pathway analysis
pals = PALS(data_source)
pathway_df = pals.get_pathway_df()

# Print the result
print(pathway_df)

Command to run: python pals_sample.py
