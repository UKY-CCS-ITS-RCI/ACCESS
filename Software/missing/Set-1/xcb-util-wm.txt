  "Software": "xcb-util-wm",
  "Overview": "xcb-util-wm is a module of the XCB (X protocol C-language Binding) project that is built upon the X protocol C-language Binding (XCB) library. It provides utility functions for EWMH and ICCCM. EWMH (Extended Window Manager Hints) is a standard protocol for modern X Window System desktops. ICCCM (Inter-Client Communications Conventions Manual) is a protocol that maintains standards for applications interactions on the X Window System.",
  "Core Features": ["EWMH and ICCCM functionality support", "Utility functions for EWMH and ICCCM", "Standalone function set for X Window System interaction", "Low-level library designed for interoperability with Xlib and other XCB-util libraries"],

Use Case: Use;
For developers creating X Window System applications that need to interact with window manager standards EWMH and ICCCM. The utility provides a programming interface that facilitates these interactions.

Code details and examples: Code;
Sample code snippets are not readily available for xcb-util-wm and being a low level utility, itâ€™s mainly used implicitly by other higher level libraries like QT, GTK or other windowing systems.

Command to run them:
Being a utility library, xcb-util-wm does not have a standalone command to run. It is implicitly used by higher-level libraries in their commands.
