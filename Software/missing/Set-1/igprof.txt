Code details and examples: 
Code:

# Run the profiler with your application
igprof -pp -o myapp.prof ./myapp

# Then analyze the output
igprof-analyse -v -d -g myapp.prof

# For memory profiling,
igprof -mp -z -o myapp.memprof ./myapp

# Analyze the memory output
igprof-analyse -v -b -d -g myapp.memprof

Note: Replace `myapp` with your actual application.
