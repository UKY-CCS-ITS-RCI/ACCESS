Use Case: Use Intel Advisor to analyze and optimize your C++, Fortran, or Python applications. It allows you to visualize hardware bottlenecks and provides suggestions for effective SIMD vectorization, threading, and GPU offloading.

Code Details and Examples: Code to run a Vectorization Advisor tool can be similar to: 

```
advixe-cl --collect=survey --project-dir=./advisor_project -- ./myApp
advixe-cl --collect=tripcounts --flop --project-dir=./advisor_project -- ./myApp
```

Please ensure that the application './myApp' is present and executable.
