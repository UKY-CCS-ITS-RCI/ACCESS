Use Case: 
Use ; To develop a neural network model for image classification.

Code details and examples: 
Code:
```
# Import the required library
import tensorflow as tf

# Load and prepare the dataset
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

# Build the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Choose the optimizer and loss function
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train and evaluate the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)
model.evaluate(x_test,  y_test, verbose=2)
```
The input is a dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The model is trained on this dataset and then evaluated on a test set.

To run the script, save it as a .py file and use the command `python filename.py`.
