Use Case: 
The Intel Compiler Runtime can be used to develop and optimize high-performance applications for Intel processors. It provides high-level abstractions and optimizations that can improve the performance of applications in various domains, including numerical simulations, data analytics, and machine learning.

Code details and examples:
// Sample C++ program 
Code: 
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
// Command to compile this program with the Intel Compiler
Command: `icpc hello_world.cpp -o hello_world`
