Code details and examples:

Use Case: Use libxscrnsaver to check for idle time of the screen.

Code:
```c
#include <X11/extensions/scrnsaver.h>

int main() {
    Display *dpy = XOpenDisplay(NULL);
    XScreenSaverInfo *info = XScreenSaverAllocInfo();
    XScreenSaverQueryInfo(dpy, DefaultRootWindow(dpy), info);
    
    /* printing idle time */
    printf("%u", info->idle);
    
    XFree(info);
    XCloseDisplay(dpy);
}
```
To compile this code, use the following command:
```shell
gcc file.c -lX11 -lXss -o output
```
To run the compiled code, use:
```shell
./output
```
Where 'file.c' is the file where above code is written, 'output' is the executable file name you want to give.
