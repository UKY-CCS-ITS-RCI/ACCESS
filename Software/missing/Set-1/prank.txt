  "Software": "PRANK",
  "Overview": "PRANK is a probabilistic multiple alignment program for DNA, codon and amino-acid sequences. It's based on a novel algorithm that treats insertions correctly and avoids over-estimation of the number of deletion events.",
  "Core Features": [
    "Probabilistic multiple sequence alignment",
    "Correct treatment of insertions and deletion events",
    "Support for DNA, Codon, and Amino-Acid sequences",
    "Generates reliable and accurate alignments"
  ],

Use Case: For instance, if you have a set of DNA sequences and you are interested in finding the optimal multiple sequence alignment among them you can use PRANK.

Code details and examples: 

Start first by loading the fasta format input file containing your DNA sequences.

```bash
prank -d=input.fasta
```

The above command will run PRANK with your input file and generate the multiple alignment result.
