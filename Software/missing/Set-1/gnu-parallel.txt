Use Case: GNU Parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one or more compute nodes. It is used to speed up processing by using multiple cores and servers, maximizing efficiency. It also helps integrate with CPU schedulers to distribute system load appropriately, protects against blocked jobs. GNU Parallel is widely used in data crunching and data analysis, especially where multiple CPU cores and servers are involved.

Code details and examples:
Code: Parallelizing a loop
This script runs createSQL.sh for every csv file in the current level

```bash
ls *.csv | parallel ./createSQL.sh {}
```

Code: Using parallel with find 
This script searches for .csv files and applies createSQL.sh to each

```bash
find . -name '*.csv' | parallel ./createSQL.sh
```

Code: Splitting STDIN and piping to a command 
This script runs wc on a text file where each word is a job 

```bash
cat bigfile.txt | parallel --pipe wc -w
```
