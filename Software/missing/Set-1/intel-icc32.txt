Use Case: 

Use: Intel-icc32 is perfect for applications that require maximum performance and efficiency. Ideal for computationally intensive simulations in fields such as physics or bioinformatics.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

Assuming a C file named 'program.c', you can compile it using the Intel icc compiler like this:

```bash
icc -o program program.c
```

In this case, 'program.c' is the source file and 'program' is the output file.

To enable optimizations, use the -O3 flag:

```bash
icc -O3 -o program program.c
```

The -O3 option instructs the compiler to apply high-level optimizations.

To use the automatic parallelization feature, add the -parallel flag:

```bash
icc -parallel -o program program.c
```

This command will instruct the compiler to automatically distribute computation to multiple cores if possible, increasing the performance for parallelizable sections of your code.

For more advanced use, you can take advantage of the interprocedural optimization or profile guided optimization features following the detailed guides in the official documentation.
