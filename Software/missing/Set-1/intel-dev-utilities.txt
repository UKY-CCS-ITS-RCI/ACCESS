Code details and examples: 
Code:
```
# include <iostream>
int main ()
{
  std::cout << "Hello, World!";
  return 0;
}
```
To compile the sample with Intel C++ Compiler, use the following command line: 
`icpc hello_world.cpp -o hello_world`

Use Case: 
Use ; To check the performance of this simple program, you could use VTune Profiler to analyze the CPU usage and execution speed of the hello_world executable.
