Use Case: 
Use the library for developing high performing deep learning models and optimizing neural network computations.

Code details and examples: 
Code:
```
#include <dnnl.hpp>
.
.
.
dnnl::memory::dims conv_src_tz = { batch, 3, 227, 227 };
dnnl::memory::dims conv_weights_tz = { 96, 3, 11, 11 };
dnnl::memory::dims conv_bias_tz = { 96 };
dnnl::memory::dims conv_dst_tz = { batch, 96, 55, 55 };
dnnl::memory::dims conv_strides = { 4, 4 };
dnnl::memory::dims conv_padding = { 0, 0 };
```
Command to run: 
The command could vary based on how the script is named and where it is located. An example would be 'g++ my_script.cpp -ldnnl'
