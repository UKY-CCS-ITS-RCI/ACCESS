Use Case: 
Use the AOCC compiler to compile and optimize the performance of C, C++, and Fortran code written for AMD CPU architectures. This is particularly useful in improving the speed of high-performance computation programs.

Code Details and Examples: 
Code: 
For C/C++ code, the AOCC compiler can be invoked using the following command:
```shell
clang -O2 helloworld.c -o helloworld
```
For Fortran code, the AOCC compiler can be invoked using the following command:
```shell
flang -O2 myprogram.f90
```
In these examples, the '-O2' is an option for optimization, the 'helloworld.c' and 'myprogram.f90' are the input files, and the 'helloworld' and 'myprogram' are the output executable files respectively.
