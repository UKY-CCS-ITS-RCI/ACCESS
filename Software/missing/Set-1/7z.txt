Use Case: Use 7z to compress a file or a directory using a high compression ratio; decompress an archive in various supported formats; securely encrypt files and folders in 7z and ZIP formats using AES-256 encryption.

Code details and examples: 

To compress a directory named "test_directory" into a 7z file:
Command: `7z a test_directory.7z test_directory`

To extract a 7z file named "test_archive.7z":
Command: `7z e test_archive.7z`

To add a file named "test_file.txt" to an archive named "test_archive.7z" using password-protected AES-256 encryption:
Command: `7z a -p -mhe -t7z test_archive.7z test_file.txt`
