"Software": "tacc-apptainer",
"Overview": "TACC(Apptainer) previously known as Singularity is a powerful platform for high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) workloads. It provides support for reproducible environments at TACC via container-based approach.",
"Core Features": {
  "1": "Portable: Apptainer containers can be built once and run anywhere.",
  "2": "Container Runtime: Provides both container runtime and image format support.",
  "3": "Format Agnostic: Work with any container format",
  "4": "Scalable: Allowing increase the number of nodes as demand grows",
  "5": "Security and Isolation: Container isolates the host system from harmful exploitations",
  "6": "Workload Supporting: Support for various workloads including AI, machine learning, deep learning, and big data analytics",
