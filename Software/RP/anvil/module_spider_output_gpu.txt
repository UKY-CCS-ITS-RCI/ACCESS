  modtree: modtree/cpu, modtree/gpu
    ModuleTree or modtree helps users naviagate between different
    application stacks and sets up a default compiler and mpi environment.
    For example, if you are working on the GPU  nodes, you will need to
    load the applications built with GPU support. This can be done by
     loading the 'modtree/gpu' module. Similarly, to load applications
    without gpu support, load  the 'modtree/cpu' module.  Note that by
    default, 'modtree' will initialize your environment with a default set
    of modules  such as gcc and openmpi. If you want a different
    compiler/mpi environment or a different version,  please load the
    relevant modules explicitly.  The default gcc version in 'modtree/cpu'
    is 11.2.0. This has been selected to enable AMD Milan  specific
    optimizations in the compiler.

    accelerating an array of gold-standard tooling such as BWA-MEM, GATK4,
    Google's DeepVariant, and many more. Users can achieve a 30-60x
    acceleration and 99.99% accuracy for variant calling when comparing
    against CPU-only BWA-GATK4 pipelines, meaning a single server can
    process up to 60 whole genomes per day. These tools can be easily
    integrated into current pipelines with drop-in replacement commands to
    quickly bring speed and data-center scale to a range of applications
    including germline, somatic and RNA workflows.

    PyTorch is a GPU accelerated tensor computational framework with a
    Python front end. Functionality can be easily extended with common
    Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython. Automatic
    differentiation is done with a tape-based system at both a functional
    and neural network layer level. This functionality brings a high level
    of flexibility and speed as a deep learning framework and provides
    accelerated NumPy-like functionality.

  quantum_espresso: quantum_espresso/v6.6a1, quantum_espresso/v6.7, ...
    Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of Open-Source computer codes
    for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the

    pseudopotentials.

  rapidsai: rapidsai/21.06, rapidsai/21.10
    The RAPIDS suite of software libraries gives you the freedom to execute
    end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. It
    relies on NVIDIA® CUDA® primitives for low-level compute
    optimization, but exposes that GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth
    memory speed through user-friendly Python interfaces.

  relion: relion/3.1.0, relion/3.1.2, relion/3.1.3
    RELION (for REgularized LIkelihood OptimizatioN) implements an
    empirical Bayesian approach for analysis of electron cryo-microscopy
    (Cryo-EM). Specifically it provides methods of refinement of singular
    or multiple 3D reconstructions as well as 2D class averages. RELION is
    an important tool in the study of living cells.

  swig: swig/4.0.2

  tcl: tcl/8.6.11

  tensorflow: tensorflow/20.06-tf1-py3, tensorflow/20.06-tf2-py3, ...
    TensorFlow is an open-source software library for numerical computation
    using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical
    operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data
    arrays (tensors) that flow between them. This flexible architecture
    lets you deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop,
    server, or mobile device without rewriting code.
