Use Case: Record terminal sessions and share them online.
Code details and examples: 
To record a terminal session, simply run the `asciinema rec` command:
```
asciinema rec
```
This will start recording your terminal session. To stop the recording, press `Ctrl+D` or type `exit`. The recorded session will be saved as a JSON file.

You can then share the recorded session by uploading it to asciinema.org or by using the `asciinema` command with the `-t` flag followed by the recorded file's path. For example:
```
asciinema play session.json
```
This will playback the recorded session in the terminal.
