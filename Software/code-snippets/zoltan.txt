I'm not sure about the specific software package you mentioned, but I can provide information on a similar tool called Zoltan that is often used for parallel partitioning, load balancing, and data management in high-performance computing applications. 

Use Case: Parallel partitioning and load balancing.

Code details and examples:
```bash
# Zoltan example input file format
4                             # number of partitions
6                             # number of objects
2 1 3 0.1 0 1                # object 0, coordinates (0.1,0), part 1
4 3 3 0.2 1 1                # object 1, coordinates (0.2,1), part 3
1 2 3 0.3 0 0                # object 2, coordinates (0.3,0), part 2
3 1 3 0.4 1 0                # object 3, coordinates (0.4,1), part 1
2 2 3 0.5 0 1                # object 4, coordinates (0.5,0), part 2
1 1 3 0.6 1 1                # object 5, coordinates (0.6,1), part 1

# Zoltan command to partition the objects
zoltan -np 4 -input input_file -o output_file
```

Note: The above example provides a simple input file format for Zoltan and a command to run the tool for partitioning objects into 4 partitions based on the provided input file.
