Use Case: Multiphysics simulation software

Code details and examples:
COMSOL Multiphysics is a finite element analysis, solver, and simulation software for various physics phenomena. It allows users to create custom physics-based models and simulations. Here is an example of how to run a simple electrostatics simulation using COMSOL Multiphysics:

Input file (.mph):
```
% This is a sample input file for electrostatics simulation in COMSOL
% The file defines a 2D geometry with two electrodes and sets up the boundary conditions and physics for electrostatics simulation

geometry
  Rect1: rectangle(0,0,1,1);
  Electrode1: Electrode(Rect1);
  Electrode2: Electrode(Rect1);
end

physics
  Electrostatics: 2D;
  include "electric";
end

getdata
  View1: 3D;
end
```

To run the simulation, you can open the input file in the COMSOL Multiphysics GUI and click on the "Run" button to solve the electrostatics problem defined in the input file.

Please note that the above input file is a simplified example and actual input files for COMSOL simulations can be much more complex depending on the physics involved in the simulation.
