Since "MethylPy" is not a recognized HPC software or tool, I will provide you with a similar package commonly used in bioinformatics for DNA methylation analysis.

Use Case: DNA methylation analysis
Code details and examples: 
MethylDackel is a tool for extracting methylation information from bisulfite-treated sequencing data. It can parse BAM/SAM files from whole genome or reduced representation bisulfite sequencing protocols. Here is an example of how to use MethylDackel:

```
$ MethylDackel extract -@ 4 -p 8 --CHH -R chr1:1000-2000 input.bam reference.fa output.txt
```

- -@: number of BAM reading threads
- -p: number of BAM parsing threads
- --CHH: include only CHH methylation
- -R: region to report methylation information

You can customize the parameters according to your analysis requirements and input files.
